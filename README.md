# Rails Observatory

See what's happening in your Rails app.

Rails Observatory hooks into [ActiveSupport::Notifications](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html)
with [RedisStack](https://redis.io/docs/about/about-stack/) to provide
a simple way to observe what is happening your Rails app, without third party integrations.
